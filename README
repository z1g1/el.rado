The new job search is not going great and his small apartment is filling up with cheap food containters and the last thing he needs is a wodden crate showing up.  He is the next of kin and the government, also short on funds, can not keep storing evidince from a 25 year old case.  mmc will mess around with the gear, talk about how old it is, have some nostalgia about the old tech, locate some files relating to ddm and have his interst peaked.

# The Ledgend of  El.Rado 

## The Raids:  
2025 News article from MajorNews.biz.  Set up the value of the drive with describing the shutdown of the ddm and the failure of the government to prosecute fmc at trial for running ddm though he is sent to prision on other charges.  Need to explain that one of the issues here is that fmc would not reveal the key and crypto prevented them from accessing the evidince as well as other digital files.

He decides that he will use the internal government search that he has access to as a contarctor.  His boss's monitoring system notices this search and mmc is called out on vilating comany policy AGAIN this time endulging his curiosity in a "conspiracy" and is fired. 
## The Warning:  
2036 News article for MajorNews.biz describing the gastly scene which police encountred as they investigate the murder of a shady online marketer who bragged that he knew the location of the lost trove from ddm and could sell the location of the key.  Police are not sure who committed the crime but use news speak to imply that it was m13 who zeroed in onto the target after an online post he made refered to having the key
## The Strikeout:  
2050 mmc is costing on his AU79 savings but they won't last long.  The new job search is not going great and his small apartment is filling up with cheap food containters and the last thing he needs is a wodden crate showing up.  He is the next of kin and the government, also short on funds, can not keep storing evidince from a 25 year old case.  mmc will mess around with the gear, talk about how old it is, have some nostalgia about the old tech, locate some files relating to ddm and have his interst peaked.  As the chapter ends he will post a status message to HiveNews.net about the delivery and that maybe being fired was the push that he needed to search for edr.  They keyword triggers an m13 alert.
## The Trove:  
2040 News aritcle from MajorNews.biz about the stability of AU79 vs USD during a shaky economic time period in which a bubble in He3 tradding activity combined with a further weakening of confidence in the government and a move to the bust avoiding bits economy "intorduces" the concept of a digital currency backed by math.  In the article make some mentions of the history of AU79 and how one of the only major shocks to it was when a large percentage of the finite amount of AU79 was lost from the market place when it was seized when it was invovled in ddm.  No serious mentions to ddm
## The Trip:  
2050 after realizing what he has in The Strikeout mmc has to get back in touch with someone who has the same access he had as a contractor.  The new government systems can break the obsolete encryption used by fmc to "secure" the contents of the ddm drives.  He will strike out with making contact with any of his old co-workers when he went down town.  There will be an encounter where the boss who dismissed him shows up to preasure the collegeue who mmc is having lunch with to blow him off.  mmc will take some petty payback and see that the boss leaves his id on the table, mmc pockets is so that the boss can waste some time on paper worl replacing them.  One of these coworkers will post on NiveNews.net that they met up with mmc use his username and talk about how he is a nut job to be using the last of his AU97 to get access to a lab to work on some old drives to continue the hunt for edr that got him fired.  When he returns to his apartment the crate will be gone along with some other valuables.  On the table is a note from his landlord about holding onto his junk as colateral incase his newly unemployed tenant is unable to make the rent payment.  Though the non technical landlord has not taken any of the older equipment, mmc hides the drives in his oven. 
## The Taxman:  
2045 Post on HiveNews.net the US government strapped for cash is using it's imense computational power and backlog of records to go back and find some fines to apply to people who owe back taxes, corporations that hoodwinked government reuglators with tax loop holes and any other trick to pierce the corporate shields that people place around themselves to hide thier assets from the government.  As the currency moves away from the USD to AU79 their power to control things is begining to fail.  The post should be written in a libertarain I told you so voice with a focus being on promotion of getting away from the USD and offering exchanges
## The  Trouble:  
2050 mmc retuns from his latest attempt at contacting an old co worker to find his apartment complex in a state of panic.  With tones similar to that of The Warning the complex is a crime scene, fenced off with yellow police tape with a concentration focused around the landlord's unit.  mmc and his neighbors will be forced across the street to a dinner to wait for the police to do thier work.  mms will receive updated from the people around him as well as information from HiveNews.net about the nature of the crime.  In a comment someone will bring up the article written in The Warning, though since it is from MajorNews.biz the commenter will be trolled into oblivion however, mmc will start to have some flashbacks to his fathers death.  After being allowed to return to his unit, he sees that his door has been forced open and that the message his landlord left him regarding his property is gone and other things in the apartment have been moved. In a panic he checks the oven and the drives are there, at that point there is a knock on the door which is the police with more questions.  2050 police are under funded and over worked so they are unlikley to really work the case but if they found the note or can link him to trouble with the landlord, and with his family history he could be in a bit of pinch.  When the police see a nervous mmc answer the door that is the direction things head and mmc gets to spend a few hours in the tlc of the SDPD.  As they pull away from the complex mmc sees a number of individuals bearing m13 inconography follow HIM.

This chapter is a panicked move through the sprawl of downtown San Diego with his plan to trust government incompetince and using some lifted credentials from his boss and walk back into the lab. A suit and some social engineering latter the plan launches
## The Hive:
